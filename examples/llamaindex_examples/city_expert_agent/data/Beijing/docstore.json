With more than 22 million residents, it is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city by urban area after Shanghai. It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province and neighbors Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jing-Jin-Ji cluster. \nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation and art. It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets. It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. For a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Beijing Capital International Airport was Asia's busiest airport (2009\u20132019) and the second busiest airport in the world (2010\u20132019). In 2020, the Beijing subway was the fourth busiest and second longest in the world. Beijing Daxing International Airport, Beijing's second international airport, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world. The city has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games. In 2022, Beijing became the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics, and also the Summer and Winter Paralympics. \nBeijing combines both modern and traditional style architectures, with one side of the city being modernized and renovated to fit the times, and the other half still offering traditional hutong districts. Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back over three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries, and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium AD. With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates. Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations in the world. In 2018, Beijing was the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai. Beijing is home to many national monuments and museums and has eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites\u2014the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site, Beijing Central Axis and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal\u2014all of which are popular tourist locations. Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.\nBeijing's public universities make up more than one-fifth of Double First-Class Construction universities, and many of them consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world, including Tsinghua University and Peking University. Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion, with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is a world leading center of scientific and technological innovation as well as entrepreneurship. Beijing has been ranked the city with the largest scientific research output by the Nature Index since the list's inception in 2016. Beijing hosts 176 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Red Cross Society of China.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4424, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe3303e0-7c55-4d1b-a9f6-3b645163cfe1": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe3303e0-7c55-4d1b-a9f6-3b645163cfe1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd96778a-b5b6-4459-a14c-5f475560509f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "00515c8b8248326ebeced40fc0170eb16c98aaf91d03cc4c0e8690d7c7b717e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "84d6ee6d-2a3e-4437-8bbc-b4f54f063180", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7dbd4d6f98bdec53acdfd88089a4a81c05732bfff5adddf01c9b6c6642e61d11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Etymology ==\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name Beijing, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters \u5317 b\u011bi for north and \u4eac j\u012bng for capital), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\"). The English spelling Beijing is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, Peking, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655. Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\nThe single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is \u4eac, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is \"BJ\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic Homo sapiens also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District. This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.\n\n\n=== Early Imperial China ===\n\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\nThe Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China. In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu. The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later. Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293, but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4427, "end_char_idx": 8654, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84d6ee6d-2a3e-4437-8bbc-b4f54f063180": {"__data__": {"id_": "84d6ee6d-2a3e-4437-8bbc-b4f54f063180", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe3303e0-7c55-4d1b-a9f6-3b645163cfe1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "10a28147f8f4657b7cbf241378435eb62eb5f2d1c753cf4ecaf2e8ebce3faa03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab350092-1696-41d2-ab52-fd5b10a29c10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "572ac752eb7786f0bf286c569fd43840c370edb31ee68632eee3d2ed40502c4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Ming dynasty ===\n\nIn 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang captured Dadu/Khanbaliq and razed the Yuan palaces to the ground. Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, Dadu was used to supply the Ming military garrisons in the area and renamed Beiping (Wade\u2013Giles: Peip'ing, \"Northern Peace\"). Under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies, Beiping was given to his son Zhu Di, who was created \"Prince of Yan\".\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian in 1403. The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420; this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed. Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. (A 1425 order by Zhu Di's son, the Hongxi Emperor, to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out: he died, probably of a heart attack, the next month. He was buried, like almost every Ming emperor to follow him, in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing's north.)\nBy the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape. The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place. It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci's chapel; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site.\nThe capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8657, "end_char_idx": 10995, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab350092-1696-41d2-ab52-fd5b10a29c10": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab350092-1696-41d2-ab52-fd5b10a29c10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84d6ee6d-2a3e-4437-8bbc-b4f54f063180", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "36d77c8015957ecfe3e395f2ee3b4957e895f65dd65ddada08a18d53755cdea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14af4249-a82f-4538-8c87-35f7c5ee8bce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4a838f7dbe2f49a3da41a2c55d7246679c7636eaca889858ececeea305ea22a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Qing dynasty ===\n\nDorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers) and Beijing became China's sole capital. The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the Old Summer Palace and the Summer Palace.\nDuring the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the Battle of Peking was fought. This battle was part of the Boxer Rebellion.\nThe attempt by the Boxers to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight foreign powers. During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.\nA peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hongzhang and Yikuang on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Beijing, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.\nWith the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Beijing from her \"tour of inspection\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty. The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\n\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").\nOn 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. During the war, Beijing fell to Japan on 29 July 1937 and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic-Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China.

On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tiananmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing, a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tiananmen Square with Mao. In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents in Tiananmen Square, protesting against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution, was forcefully suppressed. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. In December 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the \"policy of reform and opening up\".\nSince the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ring roads. According to one 2005 newspaper report, the newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times its previous size. Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts, while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China. In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country. The city has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Beijing has hosted major international sporting events, including the 2008 Summer Olympics, the 2015 World Athletics Championships, and the 2022 Winter Olympics, and is the only city to have hosted both the Winter and Summer Olympics.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14741, "end_char_idx": 17493, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "272715ea-f308-4555-a1bd-baab2bd98a5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "272715ea-f308-4555-a1bd-baab2bd98a5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14af4249-a82f-4538-8c87-35f7c5ee8bce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "8d071f53694f6ec134e6cb10988a36ee93d6eb5f7828320347f7ea056dfbb021", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca0eebaf-eb39-4cab-a75e-5fb7b6e24dc9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2fc8db8ca1989fc69d5c474494c5a4992ec941d8656dc4b0c718b3505c2e09a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "== Geography ==\n\nBeijing is situated at the northern edge of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing District and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by Xishan or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556 ft).\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the South\u2013North Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40 to 60 metres (130\u2013200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east\u2013west axis.\nBeijing's pattern of development from the old inner city to its urban fringe are frequently described as \"spreading like a pancake\" (tan da bing).:\u200a135\u200a This pattern of development is frequently cited as a reason for Beijing's urban problems.:\u200a135", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17496, "end_char_idx": 19799, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca0eebaf-eb39-4cab-a75e-5fb7b6e24dc9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca0eebaf-eb39-4cab-a75e-5fb7b6e24dc9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "272715ea-f308-4555-a1bd-baab2bd98a5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "b63dc1a0a3c241191921367790520fa8f21f1eb1b22b3bbc7bb312ab4cf67429", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "66a0a080-ea17-4081-8564-5d152a7b9934", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9dd747468068b6f7a9b816267ee46478c857a108422cfaf8905d7b0421068ef1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Climate ===\n Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dwa), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: BSk) in the south and in the northwest, characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and brief but cold, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. From 2001 to 2024, the hottest period in Beijing is early August, and the coldest period is late January. According to China's seasonal division standard, Beijing enters spring on 26 March, summer on 20 May, autumn on 13 September, and winter on 31 October. The average annual temperature in the urban area of Beijing is 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F) to 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F), of which the average daily minimum temperature is 7.7 \u00b0C (45.9 \u00b0F) to 8.4 \u00b0C (47.1 \u00b0F), and the average daily maximum temperature is 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F) to 18.9 \u00b0C (66.0 \u00b0F).

First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s. Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice, for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter China Zun.\n\nBeijing is famous for its siheyuans, a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called hutongs. The hutongs are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, siheyuans and hutongs are rapidly disappearing, as entire city blocks of hutongs are replaced by high-rise buildings. Residents of the hutongs are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the hutongs cannot be replaced, and these properties are often government owned.\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\nBeijing had a long history of environmental problems. Between 2000 and 2009 Beijing's urban extent quadrupled, which not only strongly increased the extent of anthropogenic emissions, but also changed the meteorological situation fundamentally, even if emissions of human society are not included. For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased. Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this \"pollution shock\" air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21580, "end_char_idx": 25385, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cee8887-c0f8-43a1-aed4-6361c875245a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cee8887-c0f8-43a1-aed4-6361c875245a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "66a0a080-ea17-4081-8564-5d152a7b9934", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ebaecfaf090b1bff5b1cc15d3eea8e3db9ee709e5017ab31aa809b25c2371a2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3198f7b8-e327-47c9-8444-2eddc3e3f191", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "059c0ff2d9dabf5356d68c8d4899c5f81ac3caf131da011fc1611d1aecbcbe59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "==== Air quality ====\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35\u201360% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\", partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\nIn preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city's air, nearly US$17 billion was spent. Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations, and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers), reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles. The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world. Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.\nCoal burning accounts for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide. Since 2012, the city has been converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry. Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions. Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015. Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making. Power plants in the coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing. Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption. There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014. Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016. Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.\nThe government sometimes uses cloud-seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events, such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area. More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of \"APEC blue\" and \"parade blue\", short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, respectively. During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.\nOn 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city. Later in the month another smog \"red alert\" was issued.\nAccording to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog \"red alerts\" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.\nIn recent years, there has been measurable reductions in pollutants after the \"war on pollution\" was declared in 2014, with Beijing seeing a 35% reduction in fine particulates in 2017 and further reduction by 2020.:\u200a52\u200a The primary factors behind this reduction were replacing coal power with natural gas and cleaning up polluting industrial facilities in the Beijing area.:\u200a169\u2013170\u200a\nBeijing's annual average concentration of major airborne fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, declined to 30 micrograms per cubic meter in 2022, the best air quality for the city since 2013.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25388, "end_char_idx": 29918, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3198f7b8-e327-47c9-8444-2eddc3e3f191": {"__data__": {"id_": "3198f7b8-e327-47c9-8444-2eddc3e3f191", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cee8887-c0f8-43a1-aed4-6361c875245a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "db9286cb2731562affc6bc4d6a6c6a93826e618665c3a8bdf79c2707d9996db8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9260d91f-2cb7-450a-821f-07052f95fad9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b9615e904a280dc9aa490a61aa85e763be682944497174886ce164a5ca0ac16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Readings ===\nDue to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).

Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.\nThe smog is causing harm and danger to the population. The air pollution does directly result in significant impact on the morbidity rate of cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease in Beijing. Exposure to large concentrations of polluted air can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, emergency room visits, and even death.\n\n\n==== Dust storms ====\nDust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.

Many expressways of China serve Beijing, as do 15 China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the ring roads that concentrically surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95), was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems. The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour. In the beginning of 2010, Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles. By the end of 2010, the government forecast 5 million. In 2010, new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week.\nTowards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour. More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.\nTo obtain a valid license plate, Beijing drivers must be selected in a lottery.:\u200a168\u200a As part of government policy support for the use of electric vehicles, Beijing drivers with fully electric cars have a much greater chance of being selected for a license plate.:\u200a168\u200a Additionally, fully electric vehicles are exempt from restrictions on which day of the week a driver may drive their vehicle.:\u200a168\u200a\nRoad signs began to be standardized with both Chinese and English names displayed, with location names using pinyin, in 2008.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\n\n==== Beijing Capital International Airport ====\n\nBeijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located 32 kilometres (20 mi) northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's Hartsfield\u2013Jackson International Airport. Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.\n\n\n==== Beijing Daxing International Airport ====\n\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located 46 kilometres (29 mi) south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on 25 September 2019. The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province.

Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.\n\n\n==== Visa requirements for air passengers ====\nAs of 1 January 2013, tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane's arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nThe Beijing Subway, which began operating in 1969, now has 25 lines, 459 stations, and 783 km (487 mi) of lines. It is the longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016. In 2013, with a flat fare of \u00a52.00 (US$0.31) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express, the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China. The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines, 450 stations, 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) in length by 2022. When fully implemented, 95% of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes. The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality.\nAs part of the urban re-development for the 2008 Olympics, Beijing's subway system was significantly expanded.:\u200a137\u200a On 28 December 2014, it switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express. Under the new system a trip under 6 km (3+1\u20442 mi) will cost \u00a53.00(US$0.49), an additional \u00a51.00 will be added for the next 6 km (3+1\u20442 mi) and the next 10 km (6 mi) until the distance for the trip reaches 32 km (20 mi). For every 20 kilometres (12 miles) after the original 32 kilometres (20 miles) an additional \u00a51.00 is added. For example, a 50-kilometre (31-mile) trip would cost \u00a5 8.00.\nThere are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city, including four bus rapid transit lines. Standard bus fares are as low as \u00a51.00 when purchased with the Yikatong metrocard.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\n\nMetered taxi in Beijing start at \u00a513 for the first 3 kilometres (1.9 mi), \u00a52.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) and \u00a51 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are \u00a52.3 (\u00a54.6 during rush hours of 7\u20139 am and 5\u20137 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour (7.5 mph). Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeots, Citro\u00ebns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion over that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11 pm and 5 am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over 15 km (9 mi) and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 72931, "end_char_idx": 76696, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "396c5b00-2956-41a0-87a1-479f434e56d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "396c5b00-2956-41a0-87a1-479f434e56d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2909ecb2-0ec0-484d-bc1a-170f9b3203d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "ea7ebf6b2bef31cf1c94b4811d06dfa0133ef6745c0f745ff70c7383e5194828", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f33aa96-d73e-4d02-82c6-8fc364f575e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Beijing.txt", "file_name": "Beijing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 83225, "creation_date": "2025-03-26", "last_modified_date": "2025-03-26"}, "hash": "603ffdd772fc36ee4422c082fe02e50c55c27759ca0564598d2af70c63f7d6c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8aeb0b22-14fe-488a-98eb-4c91abb90b98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e146bc8f104dfd88e85348305e83cde520cf6cd3599fba15064f78774d099550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "=== Bicycles ===\n\nBeijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale. On 30 March 2019, a 6.5 km (4 mile) bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between Huilongguan and Shangdi where there are many high-tech companies. Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo since 2016.\n\n\n== Defence and aerospace ==\n\nThe command headquarters of China's military forces are based in Beijing. The Central Military Commission, the political organ in charge of the military, is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense, located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in western Beijing. The Rocket Force, which controls the country's strategic missile and nuclear weapons, has its command in Qinghe, Haidian District. The headquarters of the Central Theater Command, one of five nationally, is based further west in Gaojing. The CTR oversees the Beijing Capital Garrison as well as the 81st, 82nd and 83rd Armies, which are based in Hebei.\nMilitary institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science, military hospitals such as the 301, 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and army-affiliated cultural entities such as 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe.\nThe China National Space Administration, which oversees country's space program, and several space-related state owned companies, such as CASTC and CASIC, are all based in Beijing.

The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander, Amur stickleback, and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District. To the south of the city, the Beijing Milu Park is home to one of the largest herds of P\u00e8re David's deer, which are now extinct in the wild. Endemic to Beijing is the Beijing barbastelle, a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007. The mountains of Fangshan are also the natural habitat for the more common Beijing mouse-eared bat, large myotis, greater horseshoe bat, and Rickett's big-footed bat.\nEach year, Beijing hosts 200\u2013300 species of migratory birds including the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo, and the endangered yellow-breasted bunting. In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged and have been traced as far as India, Kenya and Mozambique. In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets. Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit, and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum. The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae (an evergreen in the cypress family) and the pagoda tree (a deciduous tree in the bean family, also called the Chinese scholar tree). The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.
